## Introduction

A thorough Crime Prediction Model is presented by Team Sherlocked to predict crime hotspots, trends, and offender characteristics for the best possible law enforcement tactics. The approach provides hotspot mapping, suspect identification, and crime classification by utilizing AI algorithms and advanced analytics. Data visualization and deployment recommendations are made easier with the help of an intuitive interface. Proactive intervention is made possible through anomaly detection, and predicted accuracy is improved through the integration of LSTM, GCN. Database administration, data processing, and visualization are all part of the architecture stack of the model. The technology facilitates community interaction and improves public safety measures by providing real-time crime updates and individualized help through a distinctive chatbot. This sets the stage for a proactive approach to crime prevention.
